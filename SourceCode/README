TO BE ABLE TO RUN THE PROJECT THROUGH ECLIPSE YOU NEED TO FIRST HAVE THE JAVAFX SDK INSTALLED.

TO DO THIS, YOU NEED TO FIRST DOWNLOAD THE LATEST RELEASE OF THE ECLIPSE 4.5 SKD HERE: http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/

OPEN UP YOUR ECLIPSE IDE, GO TO HELP -> INSTALL NEW SOFTWARE AND INSERT THE FOLLOWING:

	UNDER NAME TYPE: e(fx)clipse

	UNDER LOCATION COPY AND PASTE THIS ADDRESS:
 	http://download.eclipse.org/efxclipse/updates-released/2.1.0/site/

	PRESS OK

CHECK ONLY THE ENTRY CORRESPONDING TO YOUR RELEASE:
	
	e(fx)clipse - IDE

ALSO CHECK THE “Contact all update sites during install to find required software” box

GO THROUGH THE WIZARD AND WHEN ASKED TO RESTART, RESTART ECLIPSE
	
MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO DO THIS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING LINK:

	http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-lazy

———————————————————————————————————————

IF THE JAVAFX SKD IS INSTALLED, CREATE A NEW JAVAFX PROJECT IN ECLIPSE. BY GOING TO FILE -> NEW -> OTHER

GO INTO THE JAVAFX FOLDER AND SELECT JAVAFX PROJECT, PRESS NEXT AND GIVE THE PROJECT A NAME. PRESS FINISH

NEXT, RIGHT CLICK THE PROJECT IN THE PACKAGE EXPLORER AND GO TO BUILD PATH -> CONFIGURE BUILD PATH.

UNDER THE LIBRARIES TAB, PRESS ADD EXTERNAL JARS AND FIND THE FOLLOWING JAR FILE INCLUDED IN THE ZIP: sqlite-jdbc-3.8.11.2.jar

PRESS APPLY AND OK.

———————————————————————————————————————

ONCE THE BUILD PATH HAS BEEN CONFIGURED, YOU NEED TO MOVE THE SOURCE CODE INTO THE PROJECT. 

OPEN UP THE FOLDER AND THE SRC FOLDER AND DELETE THE PACKAGE APPLICATION.

NOW FIND THE SOURCE CODE FOLDER AND DRAG AND DROP THE FORTY (40) FILES INTO THE SRC FOLDER. THIS WILL AUTOMATICALLY SPLIT UP THE FXML FILES AND THE JAVA FILES

LAST THING YOU NEED TO DO IS DRAG AND DROP THE team4.db FILE INTO THE PROJECT FOLDER (NOT THE SRC FOLDER)

NOW OPEN UP HOME.JAVA AND PRESS RUN
