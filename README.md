#Gothenburg Restaurants

Gothenburg Restaursnts is a Decision Support System that helps users locate restaurants based on an entered postale code. The system was created using Java, JavaFX, and SQLite. The system aims to simplify the search process for restaurants by allowing users to filter out restaurants that do not fit their search criteria.
